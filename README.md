# KWG - KAREL WORLD GENERATOR

I created this program as coding "exercise".
Program generates Karel world from text structure inside of *input file*.

## TUTORIAL:

### - Running:

On *UNIX* run with:
```console
./kwg path_to_map_text_file beepers_amount_at_start
```

On *Windows* run **THROUGH COMMAND LINE** with:
```console
KWG path_to_map_text_file beepers_amount_at_start
```

### - Preparing map for generator:
 
 - To get valid result from generator you have to prepare **VALID input file**. But don't worry it is actually very easy process.
  
 - You just have to copy the **map from Karel output** to your favourite editor (Notepad, Vim) and **ignore first two lines** with coordinates etc.
 
 Example with Vim:![copy](https://i.imgur.com/pZuaLMc.png)
 
 *Tip for Vim*: When pasting to Vim you should toggle `:set paste!` first. Otherwise Vim will do indentation to the pasted text.

 - Type of file (.txt, ...) is **not important**. The file is passed to program as parameter.

 - After sucessfull execution program will prints out **"Done."** and generate **<input_file>.kw** in directory.

 - ##### Note: If there is map with amount of placed beepers over 99, generator won't work! Yet...

#### Flags:
```console   
   -D      Show debug info
```
